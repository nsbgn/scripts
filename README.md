Scripts
===============================================================================

Here you will find nifty scripts I wrote to make myself happier. I tried to 
make them very small and reusable, so have a look around and do with them as 
you please. 


Currently the repository contains a handful of 
[dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)-based tools, because it is so easy 
to DIY with (also consider [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)):

- [dmenu-mpv]: An interface to [mpv](https://mpv.io/), as a plain music player 
  that simply offers a shuffled list of full albums to play.
- [dmenu-pass]: An interface to 
  [pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/), as a password 
  manager.
- [dmenu-json]: A script to construct dmenus with submenus using JSON files, 
  using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
- [dmenu-thesaurus]: A thesaurus that simply loops through related words, for 
  when a word is at the tip of the tongue.


Other than that, I have:

- [keyboard-config]: A configuration script to make the keyboard more 
  comfortable, by turning Caps Lock into a multifunctional Super/Escape key 
  and Tab into Level3/Tab.
- [toggle-pointer]: A script to disable and re-enable the mouse pointer.
- [bak]: A script to keep my files backed up using 
  [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/).
