Scripts
===============================================================================

Here you will find nifty scripts I wrote to make myself happier. I tried to 
make them reusable, so have a look around and do with them as you please. 


Currently the repository contains a handful of 
[dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)-based tools, because it is so easy 
to bend to your will (also consider 
[rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi):

- An interface to [mpv](https://mpv.io/), as a DIY music player.
- An interface to [pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/), as a 
  simple password manager.
- A thesaurus that simply loops through related words, for when a word is at 
  the tip of the tongue.
- A script to construct dmenus with JSON files, using 
  [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).


Other than that, I have:

- A configuration script to make the keyboard more comfortable, by turning 
  Caps Lock into a multifunctional Super/Escape key and Tab into Level3/Tab.
- A script to disable and re-enable the mouse pointer.
- A script to keep my files backed up using [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/).
