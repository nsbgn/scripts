Scripts
===============================================================================

Here you will find nifty scripts I wrote to make myself happier. I tried to 
make them reusable, so have a look around and do with them as you please. 

Currently the repository contains:

- A [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) interface to 
  [mpv](https://mpv.io/), as a DIY music player.
- A dmenu interface to [pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/), 
  as a simple password manager.
