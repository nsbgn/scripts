Scripts
===============================================================================

Here you will find nifty scripts I wrote to make myself happier. I tried to 
make them reusable, so have a look around and do with them as you please. 

Currently the repository contains:

- A configuration script to make the X keyboard more comfortable, by turning 
  Caps Lock into a multifunctional Super/Escape key and Tab into a Level3/Tab.
- A [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) interface to 
  [mpv](https://mpv.io/), as a DIY music player.
- A dmenu interface to [pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/), 
  as a simple password manager.
- A script to construct dmenus with JSON files, using 
  [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
- A simple dmenu query for confirmation.
- A script to disable and re-enable the mouse pointer.
- A script to keep my files backed up using [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/).
