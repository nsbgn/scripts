Scripts
===============================================================================

Here you will find nifty scripts I wrote to make myself happier. I tried to 
make them very small and reusable, so have a look around and do with them as 
you please. I'm fond of using [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) / 
[rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) and 
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), because they make quick DIY scripts 
easy.

Currently, the repository contains the following dmenu-based tools:

- [dmenu-mpv](dmenu-mpv): An interface to [mpv](https://mpv.io/), as a plain 
  music player that simply offers a shuffled list of full albums to play.
- [dmenu-pass](dmenu-pass): An interface to 
  [pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/), as a password 
  manager.
- [dmenu-json](dmenu-json): A script to construct dmenus with submenus defined 
  in JSON.

Other than that, I have:

- [keyboard-config](keyboard-config): A configuration script to make the 
  keyboard more comfortable, by turning Caps Lock into a multifunctional 
  Super/Escape key and Tab into Level3/Tab. Using 
  [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape). 
- [toggle-pointer](toggle-pointer): A script to disable and re-enable the 
  mouse pointer.
- [epub](epub): A very simple epub reader for the terminal.
- [thesaurus](thesaurus): Presents a list of related words.
- [sunlight](sunlight): Calculates when the sun will rise and set using 
  [Sunwait](http://www.risacher.org/sunwait/).
- [bak](bak): A script to keep my files backed up using 
  [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/).
- [preview](preview): A script to show a text preview of a text or binary 
  file. I use this with the [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) file manager.
- [index](index): Creates a JSON directory tree.
